all political theorists are intentionists.
science is the formalization of intentionism. it speak of causation as if there is nothing in the world which something 'does not cause'.

intentionism is where individuals and groups believe that nothing worthwhile is going to happen unless it is made to happen. thus life becomes the job of making things happen the way the individual or group wants them to happen.

situationism acknowledges the natural primacy of the 'fielding' aspect of the hitting-fielding combination.

situational opportunity is the mother of intention. empty space does not orchestrate and shape assertive action, but opportunity-rich situations do. science and scientific thinkers look at dynamics framed by empty space, thus the only sourcing influence they can see is 'intention'.

"“That which gives the extraordinary firmness to our belief in causality is not the great habit of seeing one occurrence following another but our inability to interpret events otherwise than as events caused by intentions. It is belief in the living and thinking as the only effective force–in will, in intention–it is belief that every event is a deed, that every deed presupposes a doer, it is belief in the “subject.” Is this belief in the concept of subject and attribute not a great stupidity?” – Nietzsche, ‘Will to Power’ 484

nietzsche is pointing to this fundamental 'difference' that characterizes European civilization; i.e. it has put 'intentionism' into an unnatural primacy over 'situationism'.

western man believes that everything he does jumpstarts from out of his own creative genius, and denies that the first order of credit has to go to the amazing diversity he is included in that inductively orchestrates and shapes what he does. this amazing 'socket' of nature is what he is plugging into. only if he conceives of himself as an independent reason-driven machine residing and operating in a passive operating theatre, can he claim that his achievements are driven by HIS INTENTION.

nietzsche mocked darwinism's 'great stupidity' for trying to explain evolution in the one-sided terms of organismic intention [survival]. lamarck's theory had credited the excitation of the situational socket (field) for inductively evolving the assertive behaviour in the organism so that 'intention' was nothing more than 'appearances'. emerson also saw the inductive genius of nature as not only inhabiting the organism but creating it.

situationism is thus in an innate primacy over intentionism, ... IN NATURE.

Western civilized man's hubris inverts this, in his head, and proclaims that intentionism precedes situationism. in other words, he sees 'man's actions' and 'man's judgements (scientific and moral) as 'primary' [in science, this is achieved by imputing absolute space and absolute time reference framing]. since man sees his behaviour in the one-sided terms of 'intention-driven' and since intention needs direction, moral codes to guide intention arise to make a complete package out of this one-sided way of intellectually idealizing dynamics which extracts, notionally, human social dynamics from out of the full package of natures relational activity continuum.

Western civilized man believes that there is such a thing as a 'human social dynamic' that can be separated out from the overall transforming relational activity continuum, and thus he puts himself into an intellectually idealized 'operative reality' which is all about 'humans' [as if they were independent beings with internal process driven and directed behaviours] and 'what humans do' as if humans interact with one another out of the context of the relational activity continuum.

this is what comes of putting 'intentionism' into an unnatural primacy over 'situationism'; i.e. it puts humans (civilizeds) into an intellectually idealized 'operative reality', ... a fairyland inhabited by independent humans with internal process driven and directed behaviours that reside, operate and interact in a habitat that is independent of the inhabitants that reside, operate and interact within it.

Western civilization forms from humans teaching their children that the intentionist [scientific] fairyland where intellectual idealization is put into an unnatural primacy over the physical reality of our natural experience, is the 'primary reality'.

the cargo cult tribal members, who may have a fine life experience, who knows, since we cannot share another person's experience, look amusing to us because of their 'build it and they shall come' situationist approach to enticing the big metal birds to alight and disgorge wonderful presents from their shiny bellies, ... but if we suspend our mirth for a moment, we might see in this a people that acknowledges situationism. should the man go out with his club and his shopping list, beat up a woman and drag her home by her hair? or should man build a shelter and hang some fresh meat from the hunt therein, so that when he returns in the evening, he may find a lone female who, after sating her hunger and basking in the shelter's comfort, asleep in his bed.

the inverting of the natural order of 'situationism over intentionism' into a dysfunctional 'intentionism over situationism' is the characteristic feature of Western civilization which underlies the very different social dynamics of European civilizeds vis a vis the social dynamics of the world's indigenous 'sauvages'.

one does not have to be 'anti-civilization' and seek to 'destroy 'IT'. the hierarchical control structures are the artefacts of putting 'intentionism into an unnatural primacy over situationism' [i.e. putting intellectual idealizations into an unnatural primacy over our experience-based intuition].

the 'civilizeds' are people whose sociolinguistic mojo has bewitched their understanding. breaking out of the trance is the necessary and impending re-evolution.

and what can we say about all of the amazing 'scientific advances' that European civilization has architected and operationalized? much of their value is assigned on the basis of their contribution to the turbo-charging of human intentionism within the 'fairyland' 'operative reality' of a humanity separate from 'the rest of nature'. how would wolf and turtle speak for them in the talking circle. if the world is only given once, as a transforming relational activity continuum, then we would have to refer our evaluation to ongoing balance and harmonies in the relational activity continuum, rather than to 'human progress' in terms of man enhancing his [fairyland operative-reality-based] powers of intentionism.
as sir einzige suggests, the issue of separating sources and symptoms is problematic in these discussions.

all one needs to make up a bullshit predicative scenario is some noun-subjects and verbs and the attention of other noun-and-verb Indo-European language-and-grammar aficionados.

everyone comes forth with their 'who is doing what to whom' causal constructions, as if the world dynamic can be meaningfully RE-presented by causal agents and the noun-verb-predicate 'results' of 'their actions'.

science set the pattern here by deciding that inquiry into the origin and nature of physical phenomena could be meaningfully approached by considering the phenomena to be the result of the action of 'causal agents' or 'forces' or 'properties' of local systems.

modern physics came along later and claimed that 'relations are all there are' so that these 'causal agents' are exposed as 'schaumkommen', relational features in a transforming relational activity continuum.

it is only the God-like power of grammar that imputes 'reality' to the noun-subjects we invent so that we can tack on a verb and give them the power to cause the 'results' we are addressing. if one throws enough 'noun-subjects' into the mill, one can construct whatever sort of scenario one wants. noun-and-verb language is that kind of tool, and it is used by the left and the right, and the question is not 'who is using it correctly', but to look beneath the synthetic subject-verb-predicate machinery to the relational origins of the social dynamic.

if you want to stick with the 'causal agent' model of newtonian thinking, all you need to do is put together sufficient number of notional noun-subjects (doesn't matter if they are ambiguous or over-lapping in their definitions, it will all come out in the wash because the inference will be that 'they are the cause of what is currently unfolding', and so noun-and-verb language allows us to build giant tautologies wherein the internal components of a 'system' (some manifest behaviour that is commonly spoken about) explain the behaviour of the system. of course the concept of a local system is pure intellectual idealization, and explanation in terms of its 'internal components' is based on tautological propositions. within the transforming relational social dynamic, a relational activity we call a 'university' gathers, and we call it 'a university' and then we explain it 'analytically' as if it's development and behaviour was powered by subject-verb-predicate cause-effect results of its internal components and processes. thanks to this tautology, we are able to BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE UNIVERSITY as a local system with internal process driven and directed behaviour, ... and we can forget about the physical reality of the relational social dynamic, sometimes called the 'relational suprasystem' within which the university is a relational activity. by endowing an activity with noun-subject-status, we can make it APPEAR TO BE the jumpstart causal agent of its own self-authored results. the symptom becomes the source.

if you don't understand what is going on, you can manage on the basis of the physical reality of natural experience (as in the circle process of indigenous anarchism)

if you prefer to believe in causal explanations of relational phenomena, then you have to invent sufficient noun-subjects to throw up a smokescreen between commonly observed physically manifest unfoldings, and the mess of alleged causal agents that one can populate the pseudo reality of a causal explanation.

here's what the author of the article has used. note that the 'royal we' is important, .. it invites the reader to join the author inside of his perspective, .. but has no real meaning since the author has presented so many different perspectives within his commentary. here's his list of causal agencies (most of which are undefined and overlapping one another ruling out the applicability of logical propositions based on them) 
Western justice is based on the scientific-mechanical view of humans as 'independent beings' who are fully and solely responsible for the results of their actions.

this is foundational to moral judgement of individuals as in Western retributive justice.

there is also the justice of indigenous anarchism; i.e. 'restorative justice' which stems from a different view of the 'self' as a channeler of the relational dynamics of community. in this view, nasty behaviours are seen as coming FIRSTLY from the community and only secondly from the individual 'channeler' of relational social tensions.

while the child soldier is dangerous and has to be dealt with, there is no sense that justice is done by punishing the child since the sourcing of the violence tracks back to the community (relational social dynamics) the child is situationally included in, ... which includes enforcers and judges.

even in Western slave-owning community, moral judgement based retributive justice had no problem applying moral judgement to a slave breaking the laws of property ownership; e.g. by trying to break free and run away with one's self which was someone else's legally owned property. the relational social dynamic did not implicate the slave-owners because every individual in Western civilization is deemed 'independent' and fully and solely responsible for their own behaviour. 'justice', with this view of 'self' can only trace the chain of causal events resulting in an 'illegal action' back into the interior of the 'perpetrator' where it 'dead-ends' because of the view of the individual as an 'independently-existing thing-in-itself'.

newtonian science gives us Western moral-judgement based retributive justice.

the 'relations-are-all-there-are' understanding of modern physics gives us indignenous anarchist style 'restorative justice' where the primary author of the harm is understood to be the 'community' (the relational social dynamic, web-of-life or etc.). the relational sourcing of harmful behaviour manifests through the individual; i.e. the individual does not jumpstart author it.
the concept of ‘justice’ is tied up with the concepts of ‘action’ and ‘causation and responsibility’, ... this is complicated by science and its dominance in defining these concepts.

in particular, while modern physics would see forms as ‘relational’ or ‘ecosystemic’ “[In nature]… “the individual parts reciprocally determine one another.”, ... science [mainstream science and scientific thinking] sees forms as ‘real, local, independent structures whose unitary behaviours are causally derived from local internal processes’; e.g. the human body as an independent system.

science’s ‘archetypeal’ view of forms in nature seen as internal process driven and directed systems has led to homologous [intellectual idealization-based] organization structures in governance and commerce, backed by moral judgement based retributive justice which enforces ‘belief’ in them.

because society is a relational dynamic that generates tensions that are different for the different persons due to their differing situation within the relational dynamic, a disturbing behaviour on the part of an individual may indicate that the relational dynamic is putting the pinch on him that it is not putting on others. however, since science holds that the relational dynamic derives from the behaviours of ‘independent individuals’, it can only assume that the source of the disturbance is arising within the individual.

science and moral judgement work together in the assumption that (a) a disturbing (abnormal) behaviour jumpstarts from the interior of the independent individual, and (b) laws may be formulated to prohibit disturbance of the peace arising from departures from normal social relational behaviour.

the key point to observe here is that the action taken to correct ‘disturbing behaviour’ never gets back to the real source of the behaviour; i.e. the relational dynamic, but attempts to correct or eliminate the ‘disturbing behaviour’ by addressing what’s wrong with the individual through whom the behaviour manifests, rather than addressing the relational dynamic whose spring tensions are channelling through individuals who’s situation within the relational dynamic are as if they drew the short straw.

the failure of those ‘in charge of organizing corrective action’ in response to ‘disturbing behaviour’ in society, in directing their efforts to the individuals through whom these disturbing energies channel, rather than to the relational dynamics giving rise to spring tensions which discharge through individuals, ... err in their understanding of the real physical nature of ‘actions’ and ‘causation’ and their 'correctional activities' are thus the source of vicious cycles of ‘incoherence’ in Western civilization.
